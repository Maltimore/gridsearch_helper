# Gridsearch Helper
This repository contains some helper scripts to launch your parallelized gridsearch with a scheduling system like sun grid engine (in fact at the moment only sun grid engine is supported).
Additionally it also provides a python package to collect and visualize the results of the gridsearch.

## Usage - running gridsearch jobs
Place this repository anywhere on your system. This program assumes that you have an entry point into your project that is a module called main.py, containing the function main(params), where params is a parameter dictionary.

```python
# filename: main.py

def main(params):
	# ...
```

It also assumes that in the same directory as your main.py you have a file called parameters.yaml in which you have two sections, one being 'default', containing the default parameters, and the other 'gridsearch', in which parameters to be gridsearched are given with their values in YAML-lists. See the example YAML file in this repository.

Then, from the working directory in which you want your program to be run, call the entry.sh script, which is called like

```bash
/path/to/entry.sh /path/to/main.py start_idx end_idx run_name
```

Where ``/path/to/main.py`` is the (relative or absolute) path to the main.py file, ``start_idx`` is the beginning index of the task ranage, ``end_idx`` is the end index of the task range, and ``run_name`` is the name for the entire run. To call a gridsearch with indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and name mygridsearch, and assuming that the (relative) path to your main.py is myprojet/main.py, call

```
/path/to/entry.sh myproject/main.py 1 6 mygridsearch_name
```

The results will be put in ``./outfiles/mygridsearch_name``, which is a path relative to your current working directory (your current working directory is also the working directory of the program you start with ```entry.sh```). Specifically, each instance of ```main(params)``` will get a params dictionary as argument. In params, you will find the keys 'gridsearch', set to ```True```, and 'output_path' and 'gridsearch_results_path'. 'output_path' is where you should save all relevant data generated by your program. Into 'gridsearch_results_path' you should only save a file 'program_state.yaml' in which you save the final score of the current run.

## Usage - analyzing results
